The backend for the node.js library system project. A simple system that allows users to search, waitlist, and checkout books from a library of about 50 titles. Built with node.js and mysql.

This repo includes the complete node.js backend, the schemas and triggers used to create the mysql database, as well as a script written to extract some book cover images from the above csv file to be shown on the react frontend. 

I may come back in the future and clean up some things / add some features. For example, I thought about making the script a command line program and more interactive, so that it works a little smoother.

I also though about adding some extended functionality to the library system - e.g. an admin - user system, where an admin can add and remove books, or perform some actions for users.

For now though, I'm content with what I've built, as this is the first kind of full stack thing I've ever made. I know I fell short in a lot of areas, so I'd be happy to hear some feedback if you have any.
